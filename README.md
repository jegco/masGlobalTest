  - Business layer in charge of encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, stored, and changed.
  - Data layer which provides simplified access to data stored in persistent storage of some kind, such as an entity-relational database. This acronym is prevalently used in Microsoft environments.
  - Presentation layer in chargew of delivery and formatting of information to the application layer for further processing or display.
